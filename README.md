# What is it?

Android client for https://github.com/zak0/photobackup-backend, an app for automatically backing up your photos to a self-hosted server.

Both this project and the corresponding server project are part of my personal campaign to lessen my dependence on cloud services and move to self-hosted solutions.

**DISCLAIMER:** While I do use this to back up photos and videos from my Android phone, this project is very much in WIP state and should **NOT** be trusted by anyone for their only means of back up of precious photos.

# Features

- Non-destructive. Does not alter the files in any way. All metadata of uploaded files stays intact.
- Automatic backups: now runs every 12 hours, when phone is charging.
- Browsing photos on the server.
- Backs up photos and videos.
- Notifies when automatic backups are done. For that peace of mind.
- **(WIP)** Server administration from the client app
